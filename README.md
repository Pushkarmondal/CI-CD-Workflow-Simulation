# CI/CD Pipeline Workflow Simulation 🚀

Welcome to the **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow Simulation**! 🎉

This project demonstrates a simplified version of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in a highly interactive and visual manner. It simulates the flow of code from commit to deployment and monitoring, showing key stages like **Build**, **Test**, **Scan**, **Deploy**, and **Monitoring**.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: A simple, animated flow representing the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as code goes through the stages of commit, build, test, scan, deploy, and monitoring.
- **Smooth Animations**: Stage transitions and actions are visually represented with dynamic animations for an engaging experience.
- **CI/CD Concepts**: Learn about core CI/CD practices, including testing, code scanning, containerization, and monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Vercel**: V0 for development and Vercel For hosting and deployment.

## 📌 How It Works

The simulation flows through the following stages:

1. **Git Commit**: The first stage where code is committed to Git.
2. **Build**: The code is built into Docker images.
3. **Test**: Unit tests and integration tests are run to ensure code quality.
4. **Scan**: Code and Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like SonarQube and Trivy.
5. **Deploy**: The application is deployed to Kubernetes or other platforms.
6. **Monitoring**: Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana help track the health and performance of the deployed application.

Each stage is visually connected, and transitions occur dynamically to simulate a real CI/CD pipeline run.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Visual Learning**: Make the CI/CD pipeline easier to understand with a graphical simulation.
- **Interactive Engagement**: Provide an engaging and hands-on learning experience.
- **Simplified CI/CD Concepts**: Break down complex CI/CD practices into easily digestible stages.
